# Subscribe for updates

Thank you for liking this site!

If you would like to receive updates of what's new, I started to publish weekly
on [Wiki Pulse](https://ethanppl.substack.com/), a newsletter powered by
Substack. You will get the latest change made on this site once per week, plus
random links or pages I revisited and would like to share.

You can take a look at [this archive](https://ethanppl.substack.com/archive) to
get a sense of what you will receive weekly. It's free, and you can unsubscribe
at any time.
