# Reddit

Front page of the Internet?

I like the decentralized moderation of Reddit with subreddits, the contents are
based on my interest and the discussions are usually better than other forums,
websites, or social media posts. I also like the benefit of it being in a
centralized space, for easier sharing, discovering new things, looking for
trends (r/all) and bringing the different communities together (r/place).
