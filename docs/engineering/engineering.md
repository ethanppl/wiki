  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35313030))
  - The design and development of the F-15 fighter jet
- [Why Lightbulbs Might Be The Best Invention Ever](https://youtu.be/FU_YFpfDqqA)
  - From lightbulbs to vacuum tubes to computers
  - The Edison effect: in a vacuum, electrons flow from a heated element, the
    basics of diodes, triodes and vacuum tubes
  - Also, people realize connecting relay switches "tricks" electrons to do
    arithmetic calculations
  - But relay switches are mechanical, unreliable and loud
  - Vacuum tubes can replace relay switches, without the mechanical movements,
    forming early days programmable computers
- [Why do railway tracks have crushed stones alongside them](https://www.alpharail.co.nz/why-do-railway-tracks-have-crushed-stones-alongside-them/)
  - Track ballast: the sharp edge stone underneath the tracks
  - Railway sleeper: beams lay on top of ballast, perpendicular to the tracks
  - Tracks: clip or anchor on the sleeper for heat expansion or contraction
  - Ballast has to be rough and sharp to interlock each other for stability, a
    bunch of smooth-sided pebbles won't work
  - They create a flat surface, excellent drainage, cope with contraction and
    expansion, ground movement and vibration

Concrete / Cement

- Concrete = cement + aggregate (sand, gravel, etc.)
- YouTube:
  [Explaining concrete while getting buried in it | Veritasium](https://youtu.be/rWVAzS5duAs)
  - Cementitious material is the most produced solid material on Earth
  - Concrete is dense, basically not possible to get buried in it
  - Concrete hardens by hydration, not drying. Crystals of hydrated minerals
    form and interlock
  - Fun fact: regular pop (e.g. Coke) can slow down the setting of concrete
- YouTube:
  [The big problem with cement, and how to fix it | Vox](https://youtu.be/asLWBGtAhZk)
  - The embodied carbon in cement is huge, in buildings, roads, and other
    infrastructure
  - Cutdown emission: cutdown excess concrete, switch fuels during production,
    reduce clinker ration, carbon capture

Shape Memory Alloy: Nitinol (Nickel Titanium Alloy)

- YouTube:
  [How NASA Reinvented The Wheel | Veritasium](https://youtu.be/vSNtifE0Z2Q)
  - So far the best explanation of the properties of Nitinol
  - Great visualization of the phase transitions: austenite (high temp) and
    twinned/detwinned martensite (low temp)
  - Other properties: superelasticity (strain under stress), Elastocaloric
    (exothermic under stress, endothermic under release)
  - Applications: heart stents, airless tires, vortex generators on planes,
    replacing hydraulics or pressurized components
- YouTube: [Real Engineering](https://youtu.be/2lv6Vs12jLc) — More details on
  the problem of current Mars rovers' wheels

Starlink

- YouTube:
  [How does Starlink Satellite Internet Work? | Branch Education](https://youtu.be/qs2QcycggWU)
  - Starlink dish: 1280 aperture coupled patch antennas emit electromagnetic
    waves to the satellite by beamforming
  - Steering the signal: phased array beam steering (phase difference "steer"
    the angle of the constructive interference)
  - Encoding data: 64-QAM modulation (amplitude modulation + phase modulation
    encoding 64 bits in one symbol)
