Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE)

  [How NASA Reinvented the Rocket Engine | Real Engineering](https://youtu.be/RVxgyz_avQM)
  - A flame front travel through the fuel mixture in the engine's combustion
    chamber
    - Deflagration: the flame front travels _slower_ than the speed of sound
      (current rocket engines)
    - Detonation: the flame front travels _faster_ than the speed of sound
  - Rotating detonation: the flame front rotates around the circumference of the
    chamber without pulses
  - Pros/Cons: Higher efficiency and higher thrust, but still unstable and hard
    to simulate the chaotic flow
  - CRCop-42 Copper: alloy that can cope with the high fluctuation of
    temperature and pressure, and can be 3D printed
  - Aero spike nozzle to improve the engine's efficiency over a range of
    altitude, i.e., a range of atmospheric pressure
