  sites, some do explain the engineering aspect of rockets

## Resources

- [A Complete Beginner's Guide to Rockets by NASA](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/guided.htm)
  - Highly recommended, starting from the fundamentals of science, maths, gas
    dynamics and statics, to the design of rockets
  - Rockets: forces on the rockets, types of rockets, systems on rockets, and
    series of motion of a rocket flight

Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE)

  - A flame front travel through the fuel mixture in the engine's combustion
    chamber
    - Deflagration: the flame front travels _slower_ than the speed of sound
      (current rocket engines)
    - Detonation: the flame front travels _faster_ than the speed of sound
  - Rotating detonation: the flame front rotates around the circumference of the
    chamber without pulses
  - Pros/Cons: Higher efficiency and higher thrust, but still unstable and hard
    to simulate the chaotic flow
  - CRCop-42 Copper: alloy that can cope with the high fluctuation of
    temperature and pressure, and can be 3D printed
  - Aero spike nozzle can improve the engine's efficiency over a range of
    altitude, i.e., a range of atmospheric pressure
