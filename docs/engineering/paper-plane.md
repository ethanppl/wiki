  - Types of paper planes: dart, phoenix, super canard, tube, Suzanne
  - Two things that can improve any paper plane: Dihedral angle and up elevators
  - Forces: thrust, gravity, drag, lift
  - Bernoulli's principle does not apply to aeroplane wings
  - Coanda effect: air being vectored down by a curved surface pushes the wing
    upward
  - Wing loading: weight of the plane divided by the area of the wing, the lower
    means the plane can fly slower
  - A stall is either caused by too slow of airspeed or too high an angle of
    incidence
  - Boundary layer effect: air gets stuck to the surface (ball curves)
  - Reynolds number: ratio of inertial force to viscous force, high (turbulent),
    low (laminar)
  - Suzanne: turbulent flow at high speed and laminar flow at low speed
