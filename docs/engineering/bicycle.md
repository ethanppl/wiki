  - How does a bicycle work from very basic physics to the details of each
    bicycle component with interactive animations
  - Interesting bits:
    - How bicycles turn because of the slip angle and the corresponding sideway
      force
    - How bicycles stabilize because of the gyroscopic effect, the steering axis
      angle and the fork offset
    - Why the spoke in the wheels are commonly arranged in a 3 cross approach
    - Considering how the frame can handle vertical loads and pedalling loads
  - It seems like he wrote those cool, realistic, interactive animations in
    WebGL by hand ([`bicycle.js`](https://ciechanow.ski/js/bicycle.js))
