  - A book, have to ignore the title, the tone and language but take the
    concepts
  - Wealth is not an event but a process, get rich quick/fast ≠ get rich easy
  - Wealth is health, relationship and freedom, and money provides the freedom
  - Affordable means negligible opportunity cost, no regret if anything happened
  - Sidewalk: pay check to pay check is one accident to poverty
  - Slowlane: saving and investing is slow because it depends on factors that
    cannot be controlled or leveraged
  - Fastlane: building up assets value, construct a system that do the heavy
    lifting
  - Systems: rental > software > content > distribution (e-commerce,
    franchise) > human resources
  - Commandment of control, entry, need, time and scale

    - What are J-curve businesses, lead generation, marketing and sales
    - Lifestyle and mindset, ideation, scorecards and MVP
  - Starting: Not a component labor, entrepreneur is the organizing force for
    the system
    - Concept: non-J curve business aiming for 2K for 5 sales each month
    - Audience: who is frustrated, an event, a scorecard, a focus group, does
      anyone show up
    - Offer: slide deck, presentation, brochure, present it face to face, do at
      least 30 customers
    - Sales: providing the least resistance path to overcome the obstacles and
      criteria to move from the current reality to the desired reality of the
      customers. Professional sales are not pushy
    - LAPS: leads → appointment → presentation → sales
  - 100K: key person influencer, building a personal brand, making
    differentiation and publish content
  - Grow the asset, media, intellectual property, software, etc., things that
    scale
  - Bigger carrot and bigger stick as en entrepreneur. Rough roads end smooth.
