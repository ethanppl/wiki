# Entrepreneurship

Running a business.

Entrepreneurship is interesting because it is probably the fastest way (fast ≠
easy) to accumulate wealth in capitalism. But capitalism does not care you want
to accumulate wealth because capitalism is just exchange of goods. It is about
selling the right thing at the right time to the right buyer. It's seeing a need
or a problem in the market that is painful enough once you solved it people are
willing to exchange with you asset they have, most likely in the form of money.

Some like me might find entrepreneurship, capitalism, sales, marketing, etc.
sound evil, sound like bluffing or deceiving. One way that is helpful to think
about it is, it is all about exchanging value. For example, the marginal utility
of an extra cup of coffee is low for a coffee shop owner, while the marginal
utility of a few dollars relative to the coffee is low for the buyer, and it is
a win-win situation where capitalism enables exchange of the two. The process of
entrepreneurship and sales is to provide that solution to people, and find
people that can benefit from the win-win situation. People that are aware and
afraid of being deceiving are the one that won't sell snake oil, so don't worry.

And to look from the perspective of economics, entrepreneurs are the
risk-takers. Compare to the labors, entrepreneurs take the risk of the business,
in exchange for a potentially bigger reward. Bigger stick. Bigger carrot.
