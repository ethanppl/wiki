    people), finance, international exposure

    up is the most valuable skill to learn. Start learning it early.

    actions are happening

  - Talks about before and after Elon acquisition, what it's like to work there
    and the danger of being in an echo chamber

    politicians rather than builders
  - It's like a good reflection of the awesome and terrible things in company

    > but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a
    > different type of social-emotional intelligence.
