    more things (easier)
  - 5 important skills: public speaking, managing people, sales (convince
    people), finance, international exposure
  - Challenge yourself, expose yourself to risk, and make tough decisions
    without good information, without the safety net. Failing and getting back
    up is the most valuable skill to learn. Start learning it early.
  - At last, never be afraid to be a small fish in a big pond, go where the
    actions are happening

  - Talks about before and after Elon acquisition, what it's like to work there
    and the danger of being in an echo chamber
  - Before the acquisition, the bureaucratic culture makes engineers to be
    politicians rather than builders
  - It's like a good reflection of the awesome and terrible things in company
    culture and working with Elon Musk
  - I like one insight, knowing what you are good at and what you are not:
    > Elon has an exceptional talent for tackling hard physics-based problems
    > but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a
    > different type of social-emotional intelligence.

  - Being freelance is very different from working in an agency, as part of or
    leading a team
  - Agencies/directors require a degree of accountability and responsibility for
