  - People problems are important, hiring well saves time, and getting to know
    your coworkers
  - This feels like things to get right after getting the basics right, i.e.
    code is working

  - Tech is fast, take it as an opportunity to quickly catch up to the frontier
  - Try to be at the level of the seniors, and eventually will start to feel
    like one
  - Volunteer to participate and talk about accomplishments but do not overstep

  - Mostly focused on software engineer role, but the skills and practices are
    transferable to any "senior" or "mature" role
  - These are observations, not rules. The goal is to internalize the
    principles. Some of the inspiring ones are:
    - The non-technical areas: self-awareness when it comes to communication. Be
      assertive, not passive or aggressive.
    - Anticipation of the outcome of a decision/design, how will things unfold
      in the future?
    - Sponsorship: provides opportunity and exposure for others, e.g.:
      suggesting someone to lead a project
    - Make trade-offs explicit: every project cuts corners, and mature engineers
      know how much is cut
    - Empathetic: the ability to view the decisions from others' perspective
    - No empty complaints: always provide at least 1 suggestion to improve
      before complaining
    - Aware of biases: confirmation, self-serving, fundamental attribution,
      hindsight, outcome, planning fallacy
    - Understand the importance of (sometimes irrational) feelings people have:
      objectively the best might not be subjectively the best for this group of
      people

  - Technical skills, connect the dots between engineering & revenue,
    demonstrate understanding of the business domain
  - Brag document: records of completed projects, professional development,
    feedback and recognition, etc
  - Communicate well, mentor others, write documentation, and continue to learn

### Managerial Role

  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35550240))
  - Managers give up focus time, have to deal with longer feedback cycles, more
    conflicts and interpersonal issues, make fewer technical decisions, and less
    time acquiring tech skills
- [Promoted from Dev to Team Lead: 8 Things They Didn't Tell Me | Dev Interrupted](https://devinterrupted.substack.com/p/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8)
  - Quite an easy read with good examples
  - Skills don't translate: skill sets of a dev vs a team lead is different
  - Keep your instincts but change your behaviour: sometimes just asking the
    right question can unblock people
  - Communicate "why" more than "what and "how": let the team see the bigger
    picture
  - Culture is a real thing. Team leads are responsible for it
  - Clear a path for the team: unblock people. Generally three types of
    blockers: technical, dependencies and priorities
  - Spend 50% of the time on priority setting and estimation
  - Invest in the ecosystem: build relationships with other teams, sales,
    product owners, ops, etc
  - Translate engineering to executives with data: provide data and metrics
