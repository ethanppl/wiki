  - People problems are important, hiring well saves time, and getting to know
    your coworkers
  - This feels like things to get right after getting the basics right, i.e.
    code is working

  - Tech is fast, take it as an opportunity to quickly catch up to the frontier
  - Try to be at the level of the seniors, and eventually will start to feel
    like one
  - Volunteer to participate and talk about accomplishments but do not overstep
- [On Being A Senior Engineer | Kitchen Soap](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
  - Mostly focused on software engineer role, but the skills and practices are
    transferable to any "senior" or "mature" role
  - These are observations, not rules. The goal is to internalize the
    principles. Some of the inspiring ones are:
    - The non-technical areas: self-awareness when it comes to communication. Be
      assertive, not passive or aggressive.
    - Anticipation of the outcome of a decision/design, how will things unfold
      in the future?
    - Sponsorship: provides opportunity and exposure for others, e.g.:
      suggesting someone to lead a project
    - Make trade-offs explicit: every project cuts corners, and mature engineers
      know how much is cut
    - Empathetic: the ability to view the decisions from others' perspective
    - No empty complaints: always provide at least 1 suggestion to improve
      before complaining
    - Aware of biases: confirmation, self-serving, fundamental attribution,
      hindsight, outcome, planning fallacy
    - Understand the importance of (sometimes irrational) feelings people have:
      objectively the best might not be subjectively the best for this group of
      people
- [An action plan for engineering career success | GitHub The ReadMe Project](https://github.com/readme/guides/engineering-career-success)
  - Technical skills, connect the dots between engineering & revenue,
    demonstrate understanding of the business domain
  - Brag document: records of completed projects, professional development,
    feedback and recognition, etc
  - Communicate well, mentor others, write documentation, and continue to learn
- [The Curse of the Senior Software Engineer](https://www.yieldcode.blog/post/the-curse-of-the-senior-engineer/)
  - The curse of staying too long at a senior role
  - Too senior to be considered as a senior but too inexperience for leadership
    role
  - Either play the corporate game and climb the ladder, or quit the game and do
    something that doesn't care about the titles

### Managerial Role

  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35550240))
  - Managers give up focus time, have to deal with longer feedback cycles, more
    conflicts and interpersonal issues, make fewer technical decisions, and less
    time acquiring tech skills
- [Promoted from Dev to Team Lead: 8 Things They Didn't Tell Me | Dev Interrupted](https://devinterrupted.substack.com/p/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8)
  - Quite an easy read with good examples
  - Skills don't translate: skill sets of a dev vs a team lead is different
  - Keep your instincts but change your behaviour: sometimes just asking the
    right question can unblock people
  - Communicate "why" more than "what and "how": let the team see the bigger
    picture
  - Culture is a real thing. Team leads are responsible for it
  - Clear a path for the team: unblock people. Generally three types of
    blockers: technical, dependencies and priorities
  - Spend 50% of the time on priority setting and estimation
  - Invest in the ecosystem: build relationships with other teams, sales,
    product owners, ops, etc
  - Translate engineering to executives with data: provide data and metrics
- [The way that Jensen Huang runs Nvidia is wild](https://twitter.com/danhockenmaier/status/1701608618087571787)
  - Direct reports, no status reports, everyone has context, no formal planning
    cycles
- [What it's like to start a job as CEO?](https://www.ejorgenson.com/blog/what-its-like-ceo)
  - E.g.: learn quick, be curious about the details but not micromanage, big
    decisions with bizarrely little context
- [The most important skill in a startup engineering leadership](https://danielmangum.com/posts/most-important-skill-startup-engineering-leadership/)
  - Pacing, the leader pace and the member pace
  - Be honesty and transparent, constant measurement
  - Set goals, make incremental changes and carefully name the repercussions
- [What Your Job Ad Says About You](https://www.talentstuff.com/blog/what-your-job-ad-says-about-you)
  - Competitive salary and years of experience means nothing
  - Instead of listing lengthy requirements, put what the candidate is expected
    to do in the first year

  - Delegation: learn to delegate work and empower the team
  - Dopamine: changes from shipping to giving feedback, reports, etc.
  - Quality v.s. quantity: learn to build high quality team not a bigger team
  - Engagement: too much means micromanaging, too little means disengaging
  - Perception: how to show your work as a manager, clarity and visibility of
    effort
  - Success metric: Is the team shipping? Is the team happy?
- [How I've run major projects](https://www.benkuhn.net/pjm/)
  - Focus and set the project as the top priority
  - Maintain a detailed plan to success, observe and keep iterate quickly on the
    plan
  - Over-communicate, both 1-1 and broadcast updates to get everyone aware of
    what's happening around
  - Break off subproject and delegate to others to manage a goal
  - Project managers are laser focus and highly organized person, expect their
    IC ability to take a hit
