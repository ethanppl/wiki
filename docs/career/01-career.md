# Career

About working in a job.

To some, the concept of career is controversial. It's also awkward how people
identify themselves with their job title. As if work and career is the most
important thing as an adult, like which subject a kid is studying in school. On
the other hand, some might suggest the biggest growth and the biggest aspect of
life for an adult is work and career development. Sometimes not just for the
money, but a way of life-long learning and education.

  - Talks about before and after Elon acquisition, what it's like to work there

    > but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a
    > different type of social-emotional intelligence.
