Space.

Why exploring space when we have so many problems on land (e.g.
[Is NASA a waste of money?](https://youtu.be/lARpY0nIQx0))? What if our
ancestors asked why farming when we struggle to hunt? Why sailing when we have
some many problems on land? Why making planes when ship still sinks? Because
exploring new grounds often bring inspiration to existing problems.
[A number of inventions like phone cameras wouldn't exist without space exploration programs](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/infographics/20-inventions-we-wouldnt-have-without-space-travel/).
Majority of funding in space programs also goes to the people behind the
missions, some of the most skilled people in the world. They are not just wasted
and burnt.

For me, another important thing is just to figure out who we are, where we from,
where are we, and where will we be?

- [Hubble Deep Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field): A 10
  days exposure of the darkest patch of the sky reveal 3000 previously unknown
  young galaxies. Each galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars. While we, are
  living in the solar system where the sun is just one of the many stars in our
  Milky Way galaxy.
- [Pale Blue Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot): Voyager 1
  turning the camera around and taking a picture of Earth before leaving the
  Solar System. The earth is just a pixel in the vast cosmos.
