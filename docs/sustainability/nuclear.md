  [Why nuclear plants are shutting down? | Vox](https://youtu.be/KC7YD98HixM)
  - Fewer fossil fuel plants, more renewable/nuclear plants
  - Skewed safety concerns, trade-off in environmental concerns, and cost
  - Alternative clean firm power: nuclear, geothermal, long-term energy storage,
    carbon capture, etc.

  - The revenue and costs of nuclear power plants
  - Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is high for nuclear
- [Why Does Nuclear Power Plant Construction Cost So Much](https://progress.institute/nuclear-power-plant-construction-costs/)
  - Costs of nuclear power plants increased over decades
  - High construction costs, rising labour costs, constantly changing
    regulatory/QA/QC requirements
  - Possible ways to bring down the cost: mature supply chain, predictable
    regulations, public support, etc.
- [How to Scale Nuclear Power](https://a16z.com/how-to-scale-nuclear-power/)
  - Almost none of the nuclear power plant in the US is new, the cost is high
  - The success is more about managing cost, project management and policies
    rather than engineering or safety concerns
  - The safety concerns for radiation, nuclear waste or nuclear meltdowns are
    not significant any more
