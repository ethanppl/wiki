  (System 1 vs System 2)
  - **System 1**: The intuition, fast processing
  - **System 2**: Smart and rational, but slow and lazy because it requires
    effort. It makes pupils dilate.
  - Chunking: we can remember 4-5 chunks. Learning is building larger chunks
  - The more confusing, the harder to understand, the more System 2 is involved
    (applicable in advertisements)
  - Implication on education: Forcing students to do more work also helps them
    to involve System 2 more, which makes learning better. Simply listening will
    exceed the capacity of System 2 because the chunks are not large enough to
    carry all information.

  (Learning Styles Doesn't Exist)
  - There is no scientific proof that learning styles exist (lots of links in
    the video description)
  - Everybody learns better with a multimodal approach (words & pictures
    together)
  - Not what/how information is presented but what is happening in the learner's
    head, active thinking and recall is more effective

  [The 4 things it takes to be an expert | Veritasium](https://youtu.be/5eW6Eagr9XA)
  - Experts don't remember more chunks, just each chunk is larger
  - **Repeated experience**: Chess masters can remember chess boards better when
    the board makes sense, not when it's random
  - **Valid environment (regularities)**: Stock picking is bad because of the
    low validity in the stock market. Humans have a hard time accepting average
    results and we see patterns even in randomness.
  - **Timely feedback**: Anesthesiologists learn better than radiologists,
    recruitment officers also suffer from delayed feedback
  - **Deliberate practice**: Practising with System 1 doesn't help, don't get
    too comfortable while practicing

  - Edutainment: educational YouTube videos, Ted talks, Twitter, Hacker News,
    etc
  - A not-too-technical but friendly explanation of the reason why cognitive
    effort is required in learning
  - Frame "mindless" reading online as opportunities to scout topics to learn,
    but the actual learning requires time and deliberate effort to actively
    consume the content

  - Turning the handlebar to the left makes the wheel turn to the right
  - Be careful of how you interpret knowledge. There is something special about
    knowing v.s. understanding
