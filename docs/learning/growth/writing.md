# Writing

Why write?

Because writing is a helpful form of communication:

- Journal: organizing thoughts, summarizing feelings, planning for next
- Blog: transferring knowledge, explaining is the best way to learn
- Work setting: just write it down for the future, to align everyone

Be clear and concise.
