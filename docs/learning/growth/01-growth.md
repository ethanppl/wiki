# Growth

Improve one's cognitive capability.

Sometimes it's about the attitude. It's a mindset to cultivate. Articles often
describe the capabilities or common practices for one to grow, but more
importantly is the mindset behind that enables those practices to emerge
naturally. Think of growth as a habit of tinkering and questioning. The ability
to focus, to think and let the mind wonder about anything.
