  - Streaming SQL Engine: keep queries' results up to date without recalculating
  - Nodes processing messages in a format of `(key: modification)`, can perform
    filtering, join, group by, etc.
  - Indexes and caching can optimize up to a point that they can't and streaming
    SQL engine just solves it
