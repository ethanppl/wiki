  - Streaming SQL Engine: keep queries' results up to date without recalculating
  - Nodes processing messages in a format of `(key: modification)`, can perform
    filtering, join, group by, etc.
  - Indexes and caching can optimize up to a point that they can't and streaming
    SQL engine just solves it
- [My Notes on GitLab's Postgres Schema Design | Shekhar Gulati](https://shekhargulati.com/2022/07/08/my-notes-on-gitlabs-postgres-schema-design/)
  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39413972))
  - GitLab uses either `serial` or `bigserial` for primary keys, no UUID
  - `text` type with `CHECK` constraint to define length constraints
  - Use foreign key constraints except for immutable tables like logs and events
  - Partitioning on big tables to improve performance, e.g. `PARTITION BY RANGE`
    for time-series data
  - Trigram text search with `pg_trm` for faster `LIKE` search
  - `updated_at` only for tables that can be modified
  - Enums are `smallint` rather than `character varying`
- [Why SQLite Uses Bytecode](https://sqlite.org/draft/whybytecode.html)
  - Bytecode implementation vs tree-of-objects implementation of the prepared
    statement
  - Bytecode: smaller, faster, easier to understand & debug, can be run
    incrementally
  - Tree-of-objects: query planning can be tweaked at runtime, dynamically
    self-tuning, and easy to parallelize

Soft delete

- [Easy, alternative soft deletion: `deleted_record_insert`](https://brandur.org/fragments/deleted-record-insert)
  - Hard delete and create a function that dump into a schemaless table
- [Avoid the soft delete anti-pattern](https://www.cultured.systems/2024/04/24/Soft-delete/)
  - Few alternatives proposed, e.g. add state, temp table, use data warehouse

  - `work_mem`, functions and procedures, triggers, `NOTIFY`, `EXPLAIN_ANALYZE`,
    CTEs v.s. subqueries (debatable), recursive CTEs, missing indexes for
    foreign keys, `=` v.s. `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`

- [Transaction Isolation in Postgres, explained](https://www.thenile.dev/blog/transaction-isolation-postgres)
  - ACID - atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability
  - Isolation as defined in SQL 92 Standard: serializable isolation. Results of
    concurrent transactions are the same as running them sequentially
  - Anomalies: dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
  - Postgres MVCC: anything lower than the lowest active XIDs, new versions of
    existing rows and new rows are hidden
  - Postgres vacuuming: freeing XIDs for reuse since XIDs are limited to 32 bits
