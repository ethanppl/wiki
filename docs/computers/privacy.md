# Privacy

Privacy when using computers. What and where your information is stored?

Privacy is not the same as anonymity or security.

- [awesome-privacy | GitHub @pluja](https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy)
  - A list of alternative apps/services that prioritize privacy
  - I have to admit that I have a lot of work to do and a massive change to my
    workflow if I strictly follow this list

- [Let's build a Chrome extension that steals everything](https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/spy-chrome-extension)
  - Steals without user awareness, including cookies, history, screenshots, user
    navigation, and page traffic. Capturing keystrokes, input, clipboard, and
    geolocation. Also, create stealth tabs by taking over unused tabs to do bad
    things.
