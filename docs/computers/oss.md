  - Open-source maintainers are either volunteer or big company employees,
    neither is healthy
  - Companies need to improve their supply chain security, while maintainers
    need to professionalize the open-source ecosystem
  - Professionalize: invoices, business accounts, contracts, processes to set up
    and approve payments, etc.
- [The Asymmetry of Open Source | Matt Holt](https://matt.life/writing/the-asymmetry-of-open-source)
  - The asymmetry is users need open-source projects but open-source projects do
    not need users
  - This asymmetry leads to mismatched expectations. The proposed solution is to
    set up boundaries and get paid.
  - Boundaries to manage expectations. Boundaries for both the maintainers and
    the users/companies.
  - Money can come from consumers, but require time and diligence for it to be
    appealing
  - Money can come from businesses, depending on company size, legal
    requirements and other negotiations
  - Money in open source: private support, custom development, prioritized
    feature requests, etc.

  [The Hard Parts of Open Source | Evan Czaplicki](https://youtu.be/o_4EX4dPppA)
  (worth watching, hard to summarize)
  - Community developers are feeling hurt and getting tired. Having a friendly
    community is difficult
  - How communities are shaped is discussed from three perspectives: freedom,
    engagement, and community:
    - **The freedom approach:** we are gods and the hierarchy has filed us, we
      are free to do whatever we want. But having people that are just
      expressing themselves is not solving the problem.
    - **The engagement approach:** putting mix extremes and decontextualising
      discussions by design nudge viral content. Carefully designed systems to
      nudge the community for particular goals are also not solving the problem.
    - **The community approach:** contextual and intentional communication,
      maintaining healthy conversational flows. Designing other healthy choice
      architecture is a way to build a better community.

  - Author and maintainer of the Chrome extension HoverZoom
  - A collection of temptations received, including offers like collecting and
    selling user data for targetted advertisements
  - Some developers are fortunate to have a stable job to voluntarily maintain
    open-source software, but some are likely to fall into these temptations
    that deviate from the purpose of the software
