Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language, with
no runtime and garbage collector.

  - A getting start guide provided by the official Rust team
- [Command Line Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424/)
  - Replicating 14 command line tools in Rust with `clap` crate
  - Emphasize test-driven development
  - [All the code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kyclark/command-line-rust)
  - In my opinion, a pretty good way to get started on Rust for people with some
    programming experience
  - It gradually introduces the key concepts and the standard library in each
    chapter
