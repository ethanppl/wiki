  ([Lobster](https://lobste.rs/s/5jzng0/when_zig_is_safer_faster_than_rust))
  - Problems of the nuanced rules about undefined behaviour in unsafe Rust
  - Zig's advantages: explicit allocation, non-null pointers by default and
    nicer pointer dereferencing syntax
  - 1.56-1.76x faster than rust probably because of Rust's pointer arithmetic
