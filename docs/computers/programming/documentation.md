  - Sequence diagram: visualize the dynamic flow of messages across systems. Map
    out "black boxes" and show how they interact
  - Start with happy paths and then add edge cases. The flow of the happy path
    should remain as the anchor for other edge cases
  - Comprehensiveness is the enemy of comprehensibility: the code is the best
    source of comprehensiveness, keep the diagrams simple for effective
    communication
