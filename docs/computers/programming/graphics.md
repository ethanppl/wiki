# Graphics

Programs and algorithms to render graphics in computers.

I don't know much about computer graphics, would be interesting to see what I
can gather over time.

  - Cellular automation: each cell evolves based on a set of rules, like
    Conway's Game of Life
  - Looks nice at first glance, but missing quite some details, so cannot
    simulate things like siphons
  - But the HN thread contains some better examples like this
