# Graphics

Programs and algorithms to render graphics in computers.

I don't know much about computer graphics, would be interesting to see what I
can gather over time.

WebGPU

- [I want to talk about WebGPU | Andi](https://cohost.org/mcc/post/1406157-i-want-to-talk-about-webgpu)
  - A blog on a detailed history of graphics API libraries and why WebGPU
    matters
  - I find this quite helpful to understand how it goes from OpenGL, Vulkan,
    Metal, Direct3D, and WebGL to WebGPU
- [Web GPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/)
  - Resources for learning WebGPU, an API for drawing points, lines, triangles
    to textures and running computations on GPU
  - WebGPU is similar to WebGL but WebGL is a stateful API and WebGPU is not

    Conway's Game of Life
  - Looks nice at first glance, but missing quite some details, so cannot
    simulate things like siphons
  - But the HN thread contains some better examples like this
