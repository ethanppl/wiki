    design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication
    structure."

    The common terminologies and concepts.
  - Terminologies: merchant, issuer, acquirer, network or scheme, payment
    processor, PCI compliance, GDPR compliance, etc.

  - Imaginary problems are more fun to solve than the real problems
  - Optimizing over some details and losing sight of the real issues
  - The HN thread is also worth a read: it's the industry that encourages people
    to look for imaginary problems

  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36503983))
  - Command prompt, notepad, file explorer and Paint all start faster in Windows
    2000 than in Windows 11
  - While hardware has improved for faster machines, software degraded
  - Cross-platform technologies and interpreted language contribute to slow
    software, particularly startup time
  - The issue is we are capable to do it but deprioritizing it. Soon, the
    hardware advances are eaten away by poor software designs
- [Advice for Operating a Public-Facing API | Joshua Stein](https://jcs.org/2023/07/12/api)
  - Host the API on a separate hostname: for different scaling & security
    measures
  - Don't be too liberal in what you accept: strict API design, no workarounds,
    otherwise risk breaking changes down the road
  - Avoid OAuth and prefer static API tokens for simplicity
  - Stay on top of failures: hopefully, users can handle the failure themselves
    and fix their app
  - Others: log a unique ID, descriptive error responses, prefixed tokens,

  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36342931))
  - Sequence diagram: visualize the dynamic flow of messages across systems. Map
    out "black boxes" and show how they interact
  - Start with happy paths and then add edge cases. The flow of the happy path
    should remain as the anchor for other edge cases
  - Comprehensiveness is the enemy of comprehensibility: the code is the best
    source of comprehensiveness, keep the diagrams simple for effective
    communication

  - Initial design: distributed components orchestrated by AWS Step Functions
  - Problems: orchestration management hit account limits and data transferred
    between components through S3 is expensive
  - New design: single monolith structure with AWS EC2 and ECS
  - Reduced infrastructure cost by over 90%
