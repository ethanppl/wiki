  - `git blame -w -C -C -C -L 15,26 path/to/file`, ignore rename, movements,
    etc.
  - `git diff --word-diff`, diff by word, e.g. tailwind
  - `git config --global branch.sort -committerdate`, sort branches by last
    commit
  - `git push --force-with-lease`, only force push if the ref is latest
  - `git maintenance start`, cron job for prefetch and other optimizations
  - `git config core.fsmonitor true` on large repo, faster `git status`

  - Git branches are the full history of commits, not just the diff between
    branches
  - Intuitive model: branches only contains "offshoot commits". This is helpful
    explaining some but not all git operations

  - [The commit `63b36f93bf75a848e2125008aa1e880c5861cf46`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/commit/63b36f93bf75a848e2125008aa1e880c5861cf46),
    plus some comments of the commit in GitHub
  - Explains the reason for change, error message is searchable, tells a story,
    reader learns something, and it builds compassion and trust
  - Or maybe I would put it in the PR description or internal docs

  - A few I like: `merge.conflictstyle zdiff3`, `diff.algorithm histogram`,
    `push.autoSetupRemote true`
