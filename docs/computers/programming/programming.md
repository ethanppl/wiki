# Programming

Anything about writing code.

I have quite some experience in C, C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java,
Kotlin, Elixir, Solidity, and Gleam. The following guide might not be as
complete or beginner friendly as I would like it to be, perhaps I will write
more and add more links in the future.

## Resources

- [The Missing Readme](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57271519)
  - A guide for the new software engineer, highly recommend
- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/4099)
  - Similar to the missing readme, also highly recommend for all software
    engineers
  - I would say reading it from time to time gives different insights
  - It might not teaches you something that you don't know, but it summarizes
    the concepts and serves as a good reminder how to approach different
    problems as a software engineer
- [Vim Motions Playlist by ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R)
  - A YouTube playlist by ThePrimeagen to get start on Vim motions
  - A helpful guide to navigate faster in editors, a nice skill to acquire for
    all programmers
  - Vim motions, the navigation, is different from using Vim, the text editor
