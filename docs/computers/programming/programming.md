# Programming

Anything about writing code.

I have quite some experience in C, C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java,
Kotlin, Elixir, Solidity, and Gleam. The following guide might not be as
complete or beginner friendly as I would like it to be, perhaps I will write
more and add more links in the future.

## Resources

- [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
  - I did not learn programming with this guide but seems like it has some good
    reference materials
  - Key aspects: programming, math, tools, systems, theory, security,
    applications and ethics
  - For me,
    [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
    is the most interesting, probably because I went through a university CS
    curriculum.
- [The Missing Readme](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57271519)
  - A guide for the new software engineer, highly recommend
- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/4099)
  - Similar to the missing readme, also highly recommend it for all software
    engineers
  - I would say reading it from time to time gives different insights
  - It might not have taught me something that I don't know, but it summarizes
    the concepts and serves as a good reminder of how to approach different
    problems as a software engineer

## Links

Still a bit like resources, but target a specific area of computer
science/programming.

- [Vim Motions Playlist by ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R)
  - A YouTube playlist by ThePrimeagen to get started on Vim motions
  - A helpful guide to navigate faster in editors, a nice skill to acquire for
    all programmers
  - Vim motions, the navigation, is different from using Vim, the text editor
- [Database Cryptography Fur the Rest of Us | Soatok](https://soatok.blog/2023/03/01/database-cryptography-fur-the-rest-of-us/)
  - A guide to the difficulty and possible solution for database encryption
  - Confused deputies, canonicalization attacks, multi-tenancy, and the
    additional complexity in NoSQL databases
  - Searchable encryption: order-preserving or order-revealing encryption,
    deterministic encryption, homomorphic encryption, searchable symmetric
    encryption, HMAC
  - Case study on MongoDB MongoCrypt implementation
