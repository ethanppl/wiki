# Programming

Instructing computers to work for humans.

I have quite some experience in C, C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java,
Kotlin, Elixir, Solidity, and Gleam. The following guide might not be as
complete or beginner friendly as I would like it to be, perhaps I will write
more and add more links in the future.

## Resources

- [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
  - I did not learn programming with this guide but seems like it has some good
    reference materials
  - Key aspects: programming, math, tools, systems, theory, security,
    applications and ethics
  - For me,
    [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
    is the most interesting, probably because I went through a university CS
    curriculum.
- [The Missing Readme](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57271519)
  - A guide for the new software engineer, highly recommend
- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/4099)
  - Similar to the missing readme, also highly recommend it for all software
    engineers
  - I would say reading it from time to time gives different insights
  - It might not have taught me something that I don't know, but it summarizes
    the concepts and serves as a good reminder of how to approach different
    problems as a software engineer

## Sites

YouTube Channels:

- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship/videos) — 100 seconds
  explanation, code report and tutorials

## Links

Still a bit like resources, but target a specific area of computer
science/programming.

  - A YouTube playlist by ThePrimeagen to get started on Vim motions
  - A helpful guide to navigate faster in editors, a nice skill to acquire for
    all programmers
  - Vim motions, the navigation, is different from using Vim, the text editor

  - Confused deputies, canonicalization attacks, multi-tenancy, and the
    additional complexity in NoSQL databases
  - Searchable encryption: order-preserving or order-revealing encryption,
    deterministic encryption, homomorphic encryption, searchable symmetric
    encryption, HMAC

  - Breakpoints: column breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, tracing
    breakpoints, data breakpoints
  - Data visualization, expression evaluation, concurrency and multithreading,
    hot reload, time travel, omniscient debugging
  - Omniscient debugging: pre-calculate all the program states, store them in a
    database and index them for efficient queries

- [Most tech content is bullshit | Aleksandra](https://www.aleksandra.codes/tech-content-consumer)
  ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36380024))
  - Tech consuming: consuming content from the web, instead of creating
  - Reasons: Laziness, time limitation, comfortability, lack of confidence
  - Instead, spend the effort to understand and analyze content, rather than
    blindly copying

Cognitive Load:

- [Cognitive Loads in Programming](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2022-08-30-code-cognitiveload.html)
  - This is the article that brings my attention to cognitive load
  - Easy is not the same as simple. Complex doesn't necessarily mean hard.
  - Easy means low cost of creation, while simple means low cost of consumption
  - Reduce the extraneous cognitive load, the load generated by how the
    information is present
  - For example, reduce the unnecessary abstractions that make things hard to
    understand
- [Cognitive Load Developer's Handbook | GitHub @zakirullin](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load)
  - Examples of things to avoid: inheritance nightmare, too many small
    classes/modules, shallow microservices
- [Cognitive Load Theory in Software Development](https://thevaluable.dev/cognitive-load-theory-software-developer/)
  - We have limited working memory, we cannot remember more chunks, but instead,
    we can aim for larger chunks
  - A section on how to learn effectively to expand and improve developers'
    processing power

Working as a Software Engineer:

- [The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming | Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)
  1. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes
  2. You are not your code — don't take problems personally when one is
     uncovered
  3. Someone else will always know more — seek advice especially when you think
     it's not needed
  4. Don't rewrite code without consultation — rewriting code is not fixing code
  5. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience —
     e.g. nontechnical people
  6. The only constant in the world is change — be open to change
  7. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from the position
  8. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat — ideas will be
     overruled, don't take revenge
  9. Don't be "the coder in the corner" — be open and collaborative
  10. Critique code instead of people — be kind to the coder, not to the code

  - Too much conceptual abstraction but never focus on the actual problem in the
    reality
  - Solve the real issues, not fancy, interesting, boastful architectures
    > Architecture people are solving problems that they think they can solve,
    > not problems that are useful to solve
