# Cellular Automaton

A grid of cells with states that evolve according to a pre-defined set of rules.

  — most famous, the fact that it is Turing complete is fascinating

  triangular/hexagonal
- [Langton's Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_loops) —
  information flow around the loop to an "arm"
- [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) — simple rules
  but emerge interesting behaviour

  - What's been made in game of life, oscillators, gliders, guns, etc.
  - Talks about computation irreducibility, like the nature of the game is
    unpredictable, but there is an idea to achieve some predictable and
    understandable outcomes from the unruly and unpredictable nature
