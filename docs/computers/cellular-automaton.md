- [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
  — most famous, the fact that it is Turing complete is fascinating
- [Paterson's Worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson%27s_worms) —
  triangular/hexagonal
- [Langton's Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_loops) —
  information flow around the loop to an "arm"
- [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) — simple rules
  but emerge interesting behaviour

  to play. It's more human-friendly lol
