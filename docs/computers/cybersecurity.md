# Cybersecurity

Hack?!

I played CTF challenges for around a year to realize I am not as talented in
finding flaws. It requires a lot of knowledge in multiple fields and a
completely different mindset to approach problems, but it's fun.

  - One interesting idea is perfect cybersecurity might not be possible because
    of the duality of symbols. The same set of symbols (bits) is used to
    represent both instructions and data, which makes general computing devices
    possible, yet it also makes hacking possible

  - Rip data out of RAM chips by freeing the chip
  - Decryption keys, bootloader code, data, stack and heap are all in the
    physical memory
  - Physical memory encryption, like Xbox and PS5 game consoles, can counter it,
    but most CPUs on the planet don't do that
