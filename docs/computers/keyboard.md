# Keyboard

buttons ⇾ letters & symbols

If your keyboard still has CapsLock key working as the CapsLock key, I suggest
you remap it to act as the Ctrl key.

Remapping keyboard in my opinion is probably the best thing you can do to
customize your computer. For example, if you are used to typing uppercase by
just holding shift, then CapsLock is in such a convenient place but rarely used
at all. And if you know what holding down the Shift key does, then you already
know what a layer in keyboard means. The Shift key is just giving your keyboard
a new Shift layer. In the Shift layer, each key has a new meaning, in other
words, remapped to another key. Remapping keyboard is like giving the keyboard
more layers.
