- [Professional Maintainers: A Wake-up Call | Filippo](https://words.filippo.io/professional-maintainers/)
  - Open-source maintainers are either volunteer or big company employees,
    neither is healthy
  - Companies need to improve their supply chain security, while maintainers
    need to professionalize the open-source ecosystem
  - Professionalize: invoices, business accounts, contracts, processes to set up
    and approve payments, etc.
- [The Asymmetry of Open Source | Matt Holt](https://matt.life/writing/the-asymmetry-of-open-source)
  - The asymmetry is users need open-source projects but open-source projects do
    not need users
  - This asymmetry leads to mismatched expectations. The proposed solution is to
    set up boundaries and get paid.
  - Boundaries to manage expectations. Boundaries for both the maintainers and
    the users/companies.
  - Money can come from consumers, but require time and diligence for it to be
    appealing
  - Money can come from businesses, depending on company size, legal
    requirements and other negotiations
  - Money in open source: private support, custom development, prioritized
    feature requests, etc.
