  - Muscles are viscoelastic, 30 seconds stretch can help muscles retain
    strength at a longer length for 10 minutes
  - To improve permanent flexibility: 10 minutes a day for 2 months
  - However, it is unsafe to hold a stretch for too long and stretching too much
    might potentially move joints in dangerous ways

  [Ab Workout Videos Doesn't Make Sense | Sean Nalewanyj](https://youtu.be/FXloHGTJ_k0)
  - There is no need for a special routine for ab workouts. All the ab workout
    videos on YouTube exist because they drive views, higher views don't mean
    more useful. There is no extra benefit in doing 20 abs exercises in 10
    minutes, just like there is no need to cycle through 20 different positions
    to train biceps
  - Instead, focus on 1-2 exercises, find a suitable number of reps and do 3-4
    sets, just like any other muscle groups
