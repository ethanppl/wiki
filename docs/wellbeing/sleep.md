# Sleep

Sleep is important. Sleep repairs our body after a long day, improve the immune
system, reduce stress, solidifies memory for knowledge and motor skills, removes
painful emotion, improves creativity and many more. In 2022,
[the American Heart Association added sleep duration as a metric for health checks](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/american-heart-association-adds-sleep-to-cardiovascular-health-checklist),
as important as diet, physical activities, weight, blood pressure, etc.

It is recommended to sleep 7-9 hours a day with a regular sleep schedule. Avoid
exercising, caffeine, alcoholic drinks, and large meals before bed. Avoid
napping after 3 pm, relax before going to bed and avoid lying in bed awake.
Having a dark, cool, quiet and gadget-free environment helps.

- [Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)
  - I find this book helpful in helping me understand sleep. For example, the
    function of sleep, the different phases of sleep and the problems of not
    having enough sleep.
  - However, I do feel like this book gives a "threatening" tone and is a bit
    [exaggerated](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/). It gives some sort of
    "sleep anxiety" that I feel pressured to sleep and in return, I sleep even
    worse. I also try to associate all problems with bad sleep.
  - Overall, I still think this book is worth a read because at that time I had
    no idea how sleep works. It explains concepts and terminologies better than
    an ordinary article. Understanding the terminologies is a good start, just
    don't get too anxious about sleep and the claims he made in the book. Don't
    outright trust the claims and do the research instead.
