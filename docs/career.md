    more things (easier)
  - 5 important skills: public speaking, managing people, sales (convince
    people), finance, international exposure
  - Challenge yourself, expose yourself to risk, and make tough decisions
    without good information, without the safety net. Failing and getting back
    up is the most valuable skill to learn. Start learning it early.

- [On Being A Senior Engineer | Kitchen Soap](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
  - Mostly focused on software engineer role, but the skills and practices are
    transferable to any "senior" or "mature" role
  - These are observations, not rules. The goal is to internalize the
    principles. Some of the inspiring ones are:
    - The non-technical areas: self-awareness when it comes to communication. Be
      assertive, not passive or aggressive.
    - Anticipation of the outcome of a decision/design, how will things unfold
      in the future?
    - Sponsorship: provides opportunity and exposure for others, e.g.:
      suggesting someone to lead a project
    - Make trade-offs explicit: every project cuts corners, and mature engineers
      know how much is cut
    - Empathetic: the ability to view the decisions from others' perspective
    - No empty complaints: always provide at least 1 suggestion to improve
      before complaining
    - Aware of biases: confirmation, self-serving, fundamental attribution,
      hindsight, outcome, planning fallacy
    - Understand the importance of (sometimes irrational) feelings people have:
      objectively the best might not be subjectively the best for this group of
      people

Remote work

  - An AI assistant company ends remote work because of the friction in
    communication compound over time
- [The effects of remote work on collaboration among information workers | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01196-4)
  - Synchronous communication decrease and asynchronous communication (less
    "rich" media: email, IM) increase
  - The collaboration network becomes "more heavily siloed" (isolated), which
    may "impede the transfer of knowledge" and "reduce the quality of workers'
    output"
- [The Relationship Between Remote Work and Job Satisfaction | Master Theses, San Jose State University](https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8564&context=etd_theses)
  - Mediating roles of perceived autonomy and work-family conflict in the
    relationship between remote work and job satisfaction
  - Remote work → higher perception of autonomy → higher job satisfaction
  - Remote work → fewer work-family conflicts → higher job satisfaction
