  - View the career as a portfolio of skills and roles, and examine whether the
    opportunities fit strategically into the portfolio
  - Become the best at one specific thing (hard), or be in the top 25% at two or
    more things (easier)
  - 5 important skills: public speaking, managing people, sales (convince
    people), finance, international exposure
  - Challenge yourself, expose to risk, and make tough decisions without good
    information, without the safety net. Failing and getting back up is the most
    valuable skill to learn. Start learning it early.
  - At last, never be afraid to be a small fish in a big pond, go where the
    actions are happening
