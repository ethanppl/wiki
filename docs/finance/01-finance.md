# Finance

Manage money and assets.

The very basic is to understand the
[time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money). That
is the single most important concept and why finance exist. Once it's clear why
interest exist and why assets appreciate and depreciate relatively, then the
textbook way of finance study these:

- Money market, bonds, and stocks. Risk, return, volatility, yield, etc.
- Diversification, risk-free vs risky assets, Markowitz portfolio, efficiency
  frontier
- CAPM, single-index & multi-factor model, arbitrage pricing theory, Fama-french
  model, discounted cash flow
- Time-series: AR, MA, ARIMA, Vasicek model, ARCH, GARCH
- Derivatives: forwards, futures, swaps, options on financial assets,
  commodities, exchange rates, interest rates

  - AT1 bond: "Contingent Convertibles" (CoCo) act as shock absorbers if a
    bank's capital fall below a threshold. They are risky and they can be
    converted into equity or completely written off
  - Under the current UBS and Credit Suisse deal, FINMA, the Swiss watchdog, has
    no obligation to follow the traditional capital structure. In this deal, AT1
    bonds are ranked lower than equity, which means shareholders at least
    received something while AT1 bondholders got nothing

  - Targeting beginners, explained from money markets to bonds, futures, swaps,
    options, FX, etc.
  - The problem with this is it missed the most fundamental concept: the time
    value of money and why finance exists
  - Some people like these basic HTML looks, I prefer a little bit of
    formatting, setting a max width yourself would be better
