### The Trap of Money

Understand what money is. Otherwise, you might fall into the trap of money.

I got the idea from
[this Japanese book, named "Who Do You Want to Earn Money For?"](https://www.eslite.com/product/10012138072682810161003)
It claims that money is fundamentally worthless and that money cannot solve
_any_ problems. It’s not that it cannot solve some problems, it’s that money
cannot solve _any_ problems.

The book explains macroeconomics concepts really well with simple examples and
almost no terminologies. Plus a touching and engaging storyline. Unfortunately,
I can only find Japanese and Chinese copies, and links to it in book stores
website, not even a Wikipedia page for it. So, I would like to share the key
points:

- **Money fundamentally worth nothing**

  - If it has value, then money will not be destroyed and printed again
  - People want money because the society demand money for transaction and tax,
    people have to use it as a tool to trade
  - The value of the money is to facilitate trade, and the value of trade is
    that the resources and energy went into producing the goods and services for
    someone in the society
  - Money has value to individuals, but worth nothing from the perspective of
    society as a whole

- **Money fundamentally cannot solve _any_ problem**

  - Bring 100 billion to middle of nowhere is useless, money cannot be magically
    transformed to food
  - You cannot pay to solve any problems without the natural resources and the
    human that put effort into transforming those resources to products and
    services
  - Be reminded that it is the fellow human in the receiving end of the money
    that help you solved the problem, not the money itself
  - Without the people, without the society, money can solve nothing

- **If a business, government, or the whole society is to increase the amount of
  money one has, there is no actual gain for anyone**

  - Imagine a country has 100 people which need 2 bread per person, so total 200
    bread each day
  - If one day there is only 100 bread, bread price might double
  - Printing money for each person, or people using their own saving, does not
    solve the problem
  - Having more money is just competing for a bigger share of the limited
    resources
  - When the total resources are limited, money is just a relative competition
    with others
  - The true problem is the productivity dropped by half
  - The true solution is to bring back production to 200 bread
  - So, everyone all saving money is meaningless for everyone, because the
    society does not grow

Real value emerges when the society develop and the aggregate productivity grow.
If one greedily hoards resources, one is simply acquiring a larger cut in an
ever-shrinking pool. **If you only think of earning money for yourself, then you
fall into the trap of money.** You are trying to compete with others for
resources. A better way, is to think of it as what value can one provide, invest
in the society and grow the pool together.

We all care about something, whether it's a partner, a child, an animal, nature,
or anything else, we cannot protect them forever. Everyone has to leave
eventually. To hope they will be okay after we are gone is for society as a
whole to progress and protect each other.

### Finance in the academic sense

The very basic is to understand the
[time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money). That
is the single most important concept and why finance exist. Once it's clear why
interest exist and why assets appreciate and depreciate relatively, then the
textbook way of finance study these:

- Money market, bonds, and stocks. Risk, return, volatility, yield, etc.
- Diversification, risk-free vs risky assets, Markowitz portfolio, efficiency
  frontier
- CAPM, single-index & multi-factor model, arbitrage pricing theory, Fama-french
  model, discounted cash flow
- Time-series: AR, MA, ARIMA, Vasicek model, ARCH, GARCH
- Derivatives: forwards, futures, swaps, options on financial assets,
  commodities, exchange rates, interest rates

  - AT1 bond: "Contingent Convertibles" (CoCo) act as shock absorbers if a
    bank's capital fall below a threshold. They are risky and they can be
    converted into equity or completely written off
  - Under the current UBS and Credit Suisse deal, FINMA, the Swiss watchdog, has
    no obligation to follow the traditional capital structure. In this deal, AT1
    bonds are ranked lower than equity, which means shareholders at least
    received something while AT1 bondholders got nothing
