# Personal Finance

Personal finance, saving, investing, budgeting, and retirement planning.

Just my two cents:

- Might be able to get rich quickly (10 years) but not get rich easily
- The stock market is the easiest way to build wealth, where the payoff is
  decoupled from the time I have
- The stock market is a random walk with drift, invest early and regularly
- I mostly invest in ETFs, it is really hard to beat the market
- Manageable risk, sleep well, also invest in yourself
