# Personal Finance

Personal finance, saving, investing, budgeting, and retirement planning.

Just my two cents:

- The stock market is one of the easiest way to build wealth, where the payoff
  can be decoupled from time
- Based on historical data, the stock market is a random walk with drift
- Therefore, invest early and regularly rather than timing the market
- I mostly invest in ETFs. I believe it is really hard to beat the market
- One might be able to get rich quickly (~10 years) but not get rich easily
- Bear manageable risk, sleep well, and invest in yourself
