# What is this Wiki?

This is my personal wiki to record the resources and links that I think will be
helpful to myself in the future.
This wiki is inspired by [https://wiki.nikiv.dev/](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).

I try to keep each page focus, not to put too many links in one page.
If there are too many links in one page, I will try to split it into multiple
pages. The goal is to keep the wiki easy to navigate and easy to find the
relevant links.

I try to classify the links into three categories:

- **Resources**: Link to a beginner friendly guide for the topic
- **Site**: Link to a place where it contians relevant information for the topic
- **Link**: Link to any pages/videos/articles/news/posts that I think is related to the topic
