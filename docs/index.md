# What is this Wiki?

Sometimes, I vaguely remember something I read but I couldn't find the link to
it. Sometimes, I want to get started learning something but don't know where to
start. This is my personal wiki to record the resources and links that I think
will be helpful to me in the future. This wiki is inspired by
[https://wiki.nikiv.dev/](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).

The idea is to have a place to keep the links to what I think is interesting,
and hopefully, these links are helpful to my future self and others. I hope the
guides that help me get started on a topic would be helpful to others as well.
For the topics that I have more experience in, I might slowly backfill the
resources I found useful.

# How is each page organized?

I try to keep each page focused. A page will be split into multiple pages if
there are too many links. The goal is to keep the wiki easy to navigate. Each
link has some comments to aid my future self (and possibly you) to find the
right one.

I try to classify the links into three main categories:

- **Resources**: Link to a beginner-friendly guide for the topic
- **Sites**: Link to a hub where it contains relevant information for the topic
- **Links**: Link to any pages/videos/articles/news/posts that I think are
  related to the topic

I also save the links I put here to the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). So if you find a link is broken, try
searching for it in the Internet Archive.

# Where to start?

Find a topic on the sidebar that interests you, probably a topic you know or a
topic that you are recently paying attention to. If you have no idea where to
start, I suggest checking out these pages:

- [Learning](./learning) page: I believe learning how to learn is the most
  important skill to have
- [Computers](./computers) page: This page contains the largest tree in this
  wiki
