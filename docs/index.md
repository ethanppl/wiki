# What is this Wiki?

Sometimes, I vaguely remember something I read but I couldn't find the link to
it. Sometimes, I want to get started learning something but don't know where to
start. And sometimes I want to force myself to take notes of what I learned and
accumulate them.

This is my personal wiki to record the resources and links that I think will be
helpful to me in the future. This wiki is inspired by
[https://wiki.nikiv.dev/](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) (sadly most of the resources
are behind a paywall now).

The idea is to have a place to keep the links to what I think is interesting,
and hopefully, these links are helpful to my future self and others. I hope the
guides that help me get started on a topic would be helpful to others as well.
For the topics that I have more experience in, I might slowly backfill the
resources I found useful.

# How is each page organized?

Honestly, I don't know how to divide human vast knowledge into categories. I
tried to keep each page focused. A page will be split into multiple pages if
there are too many links. But you will see some pages contain way more than
others. The goal is to keep the wiki easy to navigate. Each link has some notes
and comments to aid my future self (and possibly you) to understand it.

I try to split each page into three main categories:

- **Resources**: Link to a beginner-friendly guide for the topic
- **Sites**: Link to a hub where it contains relevant information for the topic
- **Links**: Link to any pages/videos/articles/news/posts that I think are
  related to the topic

I might also add some notes on top to write down the initial "hook" that got me
interested in the topic. Often times it's a simple picture, a YouTube video, an
article, or just a concept that got me interested.

I also save the links I put here to the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). So if you find a link is broken, try
searching for it in the Internet Archive.

# Something to bear in mind when reading

- Not all sources/blogs/articles are credible or unbiased, anyone can publish
  anything on the Internet
- Everyone has their own unique experiences and opinions, take everything with a
  grain of salt
- No one can judge others' decisions because no one has the full context of each
  other's situation
- Especially reading reviews and discussion forums, who is the author and why
  should I care about their opinion?

# Where to start?

Find a topic on the sidebar that interests you, probably a topic you know or a
topic that you are recently paying attention to. If you have no idea where to
start, I suggest checking out these pages and their children pages:

- [Learning](./learning/01-learning.md) page: I believe learning how to learn is
  the most important skill to have
- [Growth](./learning/growth/01-growth.md) page: Seeking growth, improving one's
  cognitive capability
- [Computers](./computers/01-computers.md) page: This page contains the largest
  tree in this wiki, simply because that's my interest

If you want some random links, random rabbit holes:

- [Interesting](./interesting/01-interesting.md) page: things I don't know how
  to categorize, but I find them interesting
- [Write-ups](./interesting/write-ups.md) page: people write down what they
  figured out and the journey along the way
- [Astronomy](./astronomy.md) page: space is interesting
- [Sleep](./wellbeing/sleep.md) page: sleep is important
