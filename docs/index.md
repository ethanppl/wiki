# What is this Wiki?

Sometimes, I vaguely remember something I read but I couldn't find the link to
it. This is my personal wiki to record the resources and links that I think will
be helpful to me in the future. This wiki is inspired by
[https://wiki.nikiv.dev/](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).

I try to keep each page focused, and not to put too many links on a page. If
there are too many links on one page, I will try to split it into multiple
pages. The goal is to keep the wiki easy to navigate and find the relevant
links. I also try to add a few comments for each link to guide my future self
(and possibly you) to find the right links.

My thinking is to have a place to keep the links to what I think is interesting,
and hopefully, these links are helpful to my future self and others. I think
linking the resources or guides that help me get started on a topic will be
helpful to others as well. For the topics that I have more experience in, I
might slowly backfill the resources I remember.

I try to classify the links into three categories:

- **Resources**: Link to a beginner-friendly guide for the topic
- **Sites**: Link to a place where it contains relevant information for the
  topic
- **Links**: Link to any pages/videos/articles/news/posts that I think are
  related to the topic

I also save the links I put here to the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). So if you find a link is broken, try
searching for it in the Internet Archive.
